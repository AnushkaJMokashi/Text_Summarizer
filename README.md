# Text Summarizer

## Project Description
This project is a converasation summarization pipeline that processes input text and generates concise summaries using NLP techniques. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model inference, and output generation. The project mainly focuses on pipelining the ML process to streamline and automate machine learning tasks.
## Setup Instructions

### 1. Create a New Environment
To create a new Conda environment named `textS2` with Python 3.8, run the following command:
```sh
conda create -n "textS2" python==3.8
```

### 2. Activate the Environment
Activate the newly created environment using:
```sh
conda activate textS2
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Install all required dependencies from `requirements.txt`:
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Troubleshooting Installation Errors
If you encounter errors during installation, try the following steps:
```sh
pip cache purge
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install pywinpty==2.0.10
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Main Script
To start the text summarization pipeline, execute:
```sh
python main.py
```


## Requirements
- Python 3.8
- Conda for virtual environment management
- Required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`
